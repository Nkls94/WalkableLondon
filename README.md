# WalkableLondon
For those who walk!

Designing cities more friendly to residents improves the attractiveness of public space, social interactions, and urban sustainability. However, the lack of microscale design data (such as pavements, crossings, etc.) has been a major obstacle to the creation of more integrated research programmes and spatial policies. The aim of the work is to create a comprehensive database of walkability, available for London in high spatial analysis, in such a way as to promote spatial research and spatial policy for better public spaces and quality of life in the city. With the development of urban analytics, the city will have a more pedestrian-friendly character.

The aim is to present the variables in such a way that there is an active policy, which will largely meet the needs of citizens. Essentially it is an application, which will promote decision making, and better spatial policies for the most quality of life in the city.

What is happening on this platform is a measure of walking with tools that give us a better insight into what is happening in every neighbourhood in London.

On this wavelength, this website, visualize the 17 pre-processed and microscale walkability variables and the assessment indexes, in the Westminster borough. The 19 wards , that the visualization is carried out are: Abbey Road, Bayswater, Bryanston and Borset Square, Church Street, Churchill, Harrow Road, Hyde Park, Knightsbridge and Begravia, Lancaster Gate, Little Venice, Maida Vale, Maylebone High Street, Queen's Park, Regent's Park, St. James, Tachbrook, Vincent Square, Warwick, West End and Westbourne. We follow a methodology in short which is presented until the final result which is the index of walking in high spatial resolution, of 50m x 50m pixels. At the same time, the diagrams and visualization performed are helpful for the user using it.

For the data colection we applied a Google Street View audit tool on every street and crossing segment, block by block, on both ides of each street. Digitizing in polyline features, for a total of 21.47 square meters.

The dataset can be used to raise awareness of the everyday life of pedestrians, as well as to formulate policy, with a view to implementing urban mobility strategies. At the same time, the progress of urban sustainability can also be monitored. While assisting policy-makers, to use urban planning strategies, and monitor progress in urban sustainability.
